        <p>I made this site while under quarantine for COVID-19. 
            I had made it through five interviews/tests for an awesome JavaScript Developer and had my final paired coding test coming up on hackerrank. Needles to say, everyone canceled everything. I decided to do some studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam, and was not happy with a lot of the resources. This blog is just documenting what I learn. Cheers!
